    <h1>Mobb Deep</h1>
    <p>
      <strong>Mobb Deep</strong> was an American hip hop duo from the Queensbridge Houses in New York City. The group consisted of Havoc and Prodigy, and were a hardcore East Coast Hip-Hop group. They were known for their dark, hardcore delivery as exemplified in "Shook Ones (Part II)." Mobb Deep became one of the most successful rap duos in hip hop, having sold over three million records. The group saw its first major success with their second album, The Infamous, released in 1995. Mobb Deep catapulted to the top of the hardcore hip-hop scene through Havoc and Prodigy's straightforward narration of street life. In this album, Mobb Deep portrayed the struggles of living in New York City's Queensbridge Houses where Havoc grew up. Following the release of The Infamous, Mobb Deep became some of the most prolific artists of the East Coast. The production of this album was very dark and sample-based thanks to Havoc, who produced the beats from this point forward. Furthermore, the hit single "Shook Ones Pt. II", a remix to the hit Shook Ones, received critical acclaim. Three of their notable albums were The Infamous (1995), Hell on Earth (1996) and Murda Muzik (1999). The group briefly disbanded in 2012 but later reunited in 2013. Prodigy died on June 20, 2017. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobb_Deep">Wikipedia</a>
